## A-Structure-Based-Voltage-Stability-Index-in-Distribution-System-through-Dimensional-Reduction

Welcome to the “A-Structure-Based-Voltage-Stability-Index-in-Distribution-System-through-Dimensional-Reduction” project! This project aims to calculate the voltage stability index in distribution systems using dimensional reduction techniques.

**** Project Overview

This project implements a structure-based voltage stability index that can assess the stability of distribution systems under multi-node disturbances. By running the `main.m` file, users can obtain the true values and predicted values of the system.

**** Requirements

This code is compatible with the following versions of Matpower:

- Matpower 7.1
- Matpower 8.0

Please ensure that you have the appropriate version of Matpower installed before running the code.

**** Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/A-Structure-Based-Voltage-Stability-Index-in-Distribution-System-through-Dimensional-Reduction.git
   cd A-Structure-Based-Voltage-Stability-Index-in-Distribution-System-through-Dimensional-Reduction
   ```

2. Make sure Matpower is installed and added to your MATLAB path.

3. Open MATLAB, navigate to the project directory, and run `main.m`:
   ```matlab
   main
   ```

4. After running, you will obtain the true values and predicted values for voltage stability under multi-node disturbances.
